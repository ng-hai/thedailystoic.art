> Dig deep within yourself, for there is a fountain of goodness ever ready to flow if you will keep digging.
>
> — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.59

Today, we could hope that goodness comes our way—good news, good weather, good luck. Or we could _find_ it ourselves, _in_ ourselves. Goodness isn’t something that’s going to be delivered by mail. You have to dig it up inside your own soul. You find it within your own thoughts, and you make it with your own actions.
