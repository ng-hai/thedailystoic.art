As Hamlet says,

“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”

There is no time to chop logic over whether our theories are correct. We’re dealing with the real world here. What matters is how you’re going to deal with this situation right in front of you and whether you’re going to be able to move past it and onto the next one. That’s not saying that anything goes—but we can’t forget that although theories are clean and simple, situations rarely are.
