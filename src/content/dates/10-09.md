> When the standards have been set, things are tested and weighed. And the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a truly good person is in using those standards when they know them.

We go through our days responding and reacting, but it’s rare to really pause and ask: _Is this thing I’m about to do consistent with what I believe?_ Or, better: _Is this the kind of thing the person I would like to be should do?_

The work of living is to set standards and then not compromise them. When you’re brushing your teeth, choosing your friends, losing your temper, falling in love, instructing your child, or walking your dog—all of these are opportunities.

Not, I _want to do good—that’s an excuse_. But, _I will do good in this particular instance, right now_. Set a standard; hold fast to it. That’s all there is.
