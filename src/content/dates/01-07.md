title: SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND

> The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice, refusal, yearning, repulsion, preparation, purpose, and assent. What then can pollute and clog the mind’s proper functioning? Nothing but its own corrupt decisions.

Let’s break down each one of those tasks:

<p class="pl-4 tablet:pl-8 desktop:pl-12 leading-normal text-xs tablet:text-base desktop:text-lg">
Choice—to do and think right
Refusal—of temptation
Yearning—to be better
Repulsion—of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true
Preparation—for what lies ahead or whatever may happen
Purpose—our guiding principle and highest priority
Assent—to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept
the latter)

This is what the mind is here to do. We must make sure that it does—and see everything else as pollution or a corruption
