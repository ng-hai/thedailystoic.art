The samurai swordsman Musashi made a distinction between our “perceiving eye” and our “observing eye.” The observing eye sees what is. The perceiving eye sees what things supposedly mean. Which one do you think causes us the most anguish?

An event is inanimate. It’s objective. It simply is what it is. That’s what our observing eye sees.

_This will ruin me. How could this have happened? Ugh! It’s so-and-so’s fault._ That’s our perceiving eye at work. Bringing disturbance with it and then blaming it on the event.
