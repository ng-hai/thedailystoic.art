> If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don’t imagine it impossible—for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you.

There are two kinds of people in this world. The first looks at others who have accomplished things and thinks: _Why them? Why not me?_ The other looks at those same people and thinks: _If they can do it, why can’t I?_

One is zero-sum and jealous (if you win, I lose). The other is non-zero-sum (there’s plenty to go around) and sees the success of others as an _inspiration_. Which attitude will propel you onward and upward? Which will drive you to bitterness and despair?

Who will you be?
