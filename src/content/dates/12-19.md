The amount of matter in the universe is immense—on the order of trillions of atoms. What percentage of that matter does one human body constitute?

The earth, as far as science tells us, is some 4.5 billion years old and shows no sign of ending soon. Our time on the earth, on the other hand, will be what? Several decades, maybe?
