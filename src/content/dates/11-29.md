There’s that feeling we get when something happens: _It’s all over now. All is lost_. What follows are complaints and pity and misery—the impotent struggle against something that’s already occurred.

Why bother? We have no idea what the future holds. We have no idea what’s coming up around the bend. It could be more problems, or this could be the darkness before the dawn.

If we’re Stoic, there is one thing we can be sure of: whatever happens, we’re going to be OK.
